Index works seamlessly with our open source [python framework](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index).

You can use `LlamaCloudIndex` as a drop-in replace of the `VectorStoreIndex`. It offers better performance out-of-the-box, while simplifying the setup & maintenance.

You can either create an index via the framework, or connect to an existing index (e.g. created via the no-code UI).

## Create new index

In comparison to [creating new index via the no-code UI](../ui/), you can create index from `Document` objects via the framework integration. This gives you more low level control over:

1. how you want to pre-process your data, and
2. using any data loaders from [LlamaHub](https://llamahub.ai).

Note that in this case, the data loading will be run locally (i.e. along with the framework code). For larger scale ingestion, it’s better to create the index via [no-code UI](../ui/) or use the files or data sources API via [REST API & Clients](../api_sdk/).

First, load documents:

```
from llama_index.core import SimpleDirectoryReader


documents = SimpleDirectoryReader("data").load_data()
```

Create a `LlamaCloudIndex`

```
import os
from llama_cloud.lib.index import LlamaCloudIndex


os.environ[
    "LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY"
] = "llx-..."  # can provide API-key in env or in the constructor later on


index = LlamaCloudIndex.from_documents(
    documents,
    "my_first_index",
    project_name="Default",
    api_key="llx-...",
    verbose=True,
)
```

You may also optionally supply an `organization_id` string parameter to the `.from_documents` method. This may be useful if you have multiple projects with the same name under different organizations that you are a part of ([more info](/llamaparse/general/organizations/index.md)). In general, it is recommended to supply this parameter if your account belongs to more than one organization to ensure your code continues to work as more projects are created in the organizations you are a member of.

## Connect to existing index

Connect to an existing index

```
import os


os.environ[
    "LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY"
] = "llx-..."  # can provide API-key in env or in the constructor later on


from llama_cloud.lib.index import LlamaCloudIndex


index = LlamaCloudIndex("my_first_index", project_name="Default")
```

## Use index in RAG/agent application

You can use the index as a retriever, query engine, or chat engine in your RAG/agent applications.

```
retriever = index.as_retriever()
nodes = retriever.retrieve("Example query")
...


query_engine = index.as_query_engine()
answer = query_engine.query("Example query")
...


chat_engine = index.as_chat_engine()
message = chat_engine.chat("Example query")
...
```
